## Files:

- **FindComponents.c**: Main Program file.
- **GraphTest.c**: Contains tests for all ADT operations of the Graph.
- **Graph.h**: Header file for the Graph ADT.
- **Graph.c**: Implementation of the Graph ADT.
- **List.h**: Header file for the List ADT.
- **List.c**: Implementation of the List ADT.
- **Makefile**: Compilation instructions for the project.
- **README.md**: The project description file.

## Description:

- **FindComponents.c**: Reads a directed graph from an input file, finds its strongly connected components, and writes
  the results to an output file. The program utilizes the Depth-First Search algorithm to determine the strongly
  connected components.
- **GraphTest.c**: Tests every operation of the Graph ADT and checks to make sure they are working properly.
- **Graph.h**: Defines the function prototypes for the Graph ADT, including functions for graph manipulation, access,
  and other operations.
- **Graph.c**: Implements all the functions for the Graph ADT, providing functionality for graph manipulation, access,
  and other operations.
- **List.h**: Contains the function prototypes for the List ADT, defining a list of integers.
- **List.c**: Implements the functions for the List ADT, providing functionality for list manipulation and access.
- **Makefile**: Compilation instructions for the project. This file is used to compile the project using the command `make`.
- **README.md**: The project description file, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and its contents.

### Assignment: pa4

## Files:

- **Sparse.c**: Main Program file for matrix operations.
- **MatrixTest.c**: Contains tests for all ADT operations of the Matrix.
- **ListTest.c**: Contains tests for all ADT operations of the List.
- **Matrix.h**: Header file for the Matrix ADT.
- **Matrix.c**: Implementation of the Matrix ADT.
- **List.h**: Header file for the List ADT.
- **List.c**: Implementation of the List ADT.
- **Makefile**: Compilation instructions for the project.
- **README.md**: The project description file.

## Description:

- **Sparse.c**: Reads matrices from an input file, performs various matrix operations, and writes the results to an output file. The program utilizes the Matrix and List ADTs to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transpose.
- **MatrixTest.c**: Tests every operation of the Matrix ADT and checks to make sure they are working properly.
- **ListTest.c**: Tests every operation of the List ADT and checks to make sure they are working properly.
- **Matrix.h**: Defines the function prototypes for the Matrix ADT, including functions for matrix manipulation, access, and other operations.
- **Matrix.c**: Implements all the functions for the Matrix ADT, providing functionality for matrix manipulation, access, and other operations.
- **List.h**: Contains the function prototypes for the List ADT, defining a list of generic data types.
- **List.c**: Implements the functions for the List ADT, providing functionality for list manipulation and access.
- **Makefile**: Compilation instructions for the project. This file is used to compile the project using the command `make`.
- **README.md**: The project description file, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and its contents.

## Compilation:

To compile the project, use the command `make`. This will compile the main program as well as the test programs for the Matrix and List ADTs.

## Usage:

- To run the main program: `./Sparse <input file> <output file>`
- To run the Matrix test program: `./MatrixTest`
- To run the List test program: `./ListTest`

## Additional Information:

- Ensure that the input file is formatted correctly for the Sparse program to read the matrices properly.
- The test programs will display the results of the ADT operations to the console.

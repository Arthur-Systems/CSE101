## Files:

- **ListTest.cpp**: Contains tests for all ADT operations of the List.
- **List.h**: Header file for the List ADT.
- **List.cpp**: Implementation of the List ADT.
- **Shuffle.cpp**: Program file for Shuffle operation using List ADT.
- **Makefile**: Compilation instructions for the project.
- **README.md**: The project description file.

## Description:

- **ListTest.cpp**: A test suite for the List ADT, verifying each function's correctness through a series of automated tests.
- **List.h**: Header file defining the interface for the List ADT, including function prototypes and the structure of the List.
- **List.cpp**: Implementation of the List ADT, providing functionality for list operations like insert, delete, and other list manipulations.
- **Shuffle.cpp**: Utilizes the List ADT to perform a shuffle operation, demonstrating practical use of the List ADT.
- **Makefile**: Contains compilation instructions for the project. It defines how to compile and link the program and its test suites.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and its contents.

## Compilation:

To compile the project, use the command `make`. This will compile the main program (`ListClient`) and the additional programs (`ListTest`, `Shuffle`) using the List ADT.

## Usage:

- To run the List test program: `./ListTest`
- To run the Shuffle program: `./Shuffle`
- To run the List client program: `./ListClient`

## Additional Information:

- The Makefile includes targets for compiling individual components as well as cleaning up compiled binaries.
- The List ADT is a core component of this project, facilitating various list operations which are utilized in client programs.
- The test programs (`ListTest`) provide a comprehensive evaluation of the ADT functionalities and should be used to verify the correctness of the ADT implementation.
